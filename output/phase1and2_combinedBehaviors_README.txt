Data Calculated from phase 1 and 2 combined:

rawCombinedGroomRate - grooming rate calculated from the total amount of grooming across both phases, divided by the total observations (* 2 to yield a rate per hour)
rawCombinedAggRecRate - agonism received rate calculated from the total number of agonisms received across both phases, divided by the total observations (* 2 to yield a rate per hour)

percentP1Obs - fraction of observations that were recorded for the animal in phase 1 (can range from 0-1)

gcCombinedAggRecRate - agonisms received rate calculated from the weighted average of phases 1 and 2
gcCombinedGroomRate - groom rate calculated from the weighted average of phases 1 and 2
gcCombinedElo - Elo calculated from the weighted average of phases 1 and 2
