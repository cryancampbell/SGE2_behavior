Behavioral Measures
To monitor dominance rank, we collected behavioral data using weekly focal observations (NNN total hours of observation). We assigned dominance rank by calculating Elo ratings, a continuous measure of rank in which higher Elo ratings correspond to higher social status, and ratings are adjusted following any interaction between two animals in which a winner or loser can be determined. Wins increase the winner’s Elo rating and losses decrease the loser’s Elo rating, by an amount that is proportional to the expected outcome of the interaction. For instance, if an individual with a high Elo rating wins an interaction with an individual with a low Elo, their scores change only a small amount because the outcome was well-predicted based on their Elo ratings prior to the interaction. If the animal with the lower rating won the interaction, however, scores change more to more accurately describe the observed outcome.
We calculated Elo ratings in R (version 4.1.2) using the EloRating package (version 0.46.11), using all dominance interactions that occurred after the fifth and final female was introduced into a social group and before the time of biological sampling. For all females, the initial Elo rating was set to a value of 1,000 and the baseline number of points a female could gain or lose during a dominance interaction, k, was set to 100. For each interaction, k was weighted by the expected probability of an individual winning or losing, based on a logistic function that was updated after each dominance interaction. The animals’ order of introduction to their group enclosure predicted subsequent dominance rank across all NN groups (R=NNN, p=NNN, n=NN females; based on values at the time of sampling), and Elo ratings remained highly stable during the course of each phase as measured by both group hierarchy stability and dominance consistency index (mean group stability = NNN, st dev = NNN; mean group dominance consistency = NNN, st dev = NNN).
To test whether Elo ratings predicted social interactions and to investigate the link between social status-associated behavior and gene regulation, we assessed rates of received agonisms and grooming. Received agonisms were defined as the per-hour rate of agonisms received from a female’s group mates, following a pre-defined ethogram (agonisms in this context include attacks, chases, and threats). Rates were mean-centered across groups so that the average rate of agonisms received by females in each group was set to 0. This decision means that our analysis focuses on the experience of females relative to the experience of others in their social group (i.e., did a female experience more or fewer agonistic or affiliative interactions, relative to the expectation for her group?) rather than absolute agonism rates. Similarly, grooming rates were defined as the amount of time (in minutes per hour) a female spent grooming with her group mates, either giving or receiving grooming. Grooming rates were also mean-centered to 0 for each social group. Any animal that was present in her group for at least 50% of the period between group formation and biological sampling was included in the group mean-centering calculation. Note that this criterion means that a female did not have to be in the group at the actual time of sampling to be included in the group mean-centering calculation. Additionally, the length of the period between group formation and sampling differs for different data sets (e.g., because all collection of single-cell data occurred before all collection of samples for the vaccine challenge experiment) and for different groups within a data set (e.g., group formation and biological sampling occurred on different days for different groups, but was always consistent for all the animals in a group).
A single individual, DV2J, had behavioral values that were strong outliers for all three metrics (Elo, rate of agonisms received, and rate of overall grooming), whether using raw or group-centered values. The inclusion or exclusion of this single individual changed the number of significant status or behavior-associated genes. As this individual’s social experience did not fall within the range of normal experiences for the rhesus macaque females in this experiment or in past, similar experiments [cites], we dropped her from further analysis, leaving the total number of analyzed individuals at NNN. Any behavioral metrics calculated for the remaining animals in her social group that involved DV2J (Elo interactions with DV2J, grooming bouts with DV2J, or agonisms involving DV2J) were left in the dataset. However, the group was mean-centered without DV2J's values, as including her measurements skewed the values of the entire group.
