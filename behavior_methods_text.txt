Behavioral Measures
To monitor dominance rank, we collected behavioral data using weekly focal observations (NNN total hours of observation). We assigned dominance rank by calculating Elo ratings, a continuous measure of rank in which higher Elo animals have a higher status, with ratings adjusted following any interaction between two animals in which a winner or loser can be determined. Wins increase the winner’s Elo rating and losses decrease the loser’s Elo rating, by an amount that is proportional to the expected outcome of the interaction. For instance, if an individual with a high Elo wins an interaction with an individual with a low Elo, an expected outcome based on their scores, those scores change a relatively small amount. If the outcome was flipped the scores could change a relatively large amount to accurately describe the social dynamics between the animals.
We calculated Elo ratings using all dominance interactions that occurred after the fifth and final female was introduced into a social group until the time of sampling. For all females, the initial Elo rating was set to a value of 1,000 and the baseline number of points a female could potentially gain or lose during a dominance interaction (k) was set to 100. For each interaction, k was weighted by the expected probability of an individual winning or losing, based on a logistic function that was updated after each dominance interaction. The animals’ order of introduction to their group enclosure predicted subsequent dominance rank in all NN groups (R=NN, p=NNN, n=NN females; based on values at the time of vaccination), and Elo ratings remained highly stable.
To test whether Elo ratings predicted social interactions, as expected, we assessed rates of received harassment and grooming. Received harassment was defined as the per-hour rate of harassment received from a female’s group mates, mean-centered across groups so that the average rate of harassment received by females in a group was set equal to 0. Grooming rates were defined as the amount of time per hour a female spent grooming with her group mates (giving or receiving grooming), also mean-centered to 0 for each social group. Any animal that spent the majority (>50%) of the time between group formation and sampling in the group was included in the group mean-centering calculation. We also used these values to test the mediating role of agonistic (received harassment) and affiliative (grooming) behaviors on gene expression levels.
A single individual, “DV2J”, had behavioral values that were strong outliers by all three metrics (Elo, rate of agonisms received, and rate of overall grooming), both using raw and group-centered behavioral values. Inclusion or exclusion of this single individual changed the results of the model, both in number of significant genes and in the direction of measured effects. As this individual’s social experience does not fall within the range of normal experiences for the macaques studied in this experiment, or in past experiments, we have dropped it from further analysis, leaving the total number of analyzed individuals at NNN. Any behavioral metrics calculated for her group-mates (Elo interactions with DV2J, grooming or agonisms involving DV2J) were left in the dataset, however the  group was mean-centered without DV2J's values as including her measurements skewed the values of the entire group.
